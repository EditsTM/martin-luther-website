In 2014, Pastor Steinbrenner was elected as the District President of the Pacific Northwest District, providing leadership to the district and also the Wisconsin Synod for 10 years in this role. The call to Martin Luther in 2024 gave John an opportunity to both return to the pastoral parish ministry and also be near his parents and grandchildren in this area.
