These special services take place at 3:15 & 6:00pm, every Wednesday through March 25th.\n\n  The theme for the 2026 Lenten services is “It is Finished”. This series explores the prophecies of Zechariah, offering an enriching look at our Savior Jesus, particularly as these prophecies relate to the events of Jesus’ Holy Week passion, death, and resurrection.\n\nOur midweek Lenten services also give us opportunity to hear from and meet some of the other pastors in our area. We look forward to welcoming them during Lent.\n\nNote: Suppers will not be offered this year, neither after the 3:15 service or before the 6:00pm service"
