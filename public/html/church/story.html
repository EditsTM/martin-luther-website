  <section class="story-section">
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) is a confederation of nearly 
      1,300 Lutheran congregations across the United States and Canada, serving 
      more than 350,000 members who gather to hear God's Word and receive the sacraments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded in 1850, WELS is committed to faithfully proclaiming the unchanging truth 
      of God's Word. We believe the Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God and the 
      only source of truth for Christian faith and life.

        <h3>The Gospel Message</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        At the heart of WELS is the gospel—the good news about Jesus Christ. All people 
        are sinners, but God in his mercy sent his Son Jesus to live a perfect life in 
        our place and die on the cross for our sins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus rose from the dead, proving that God accepted his sacrifice. Everyone who 
        believes in Jesus has forgiveness and eternal life.
      </p>

          <h4>The Means of Grace</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          God comes to us through his Word and the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's 
          Supper. Through these, the Holy Spirit creates and strengthens faith.

          <h4>The Priesthood of All Believers</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          All Christians are priests before God. We have direct access to him through 
          Jesus Christ and are called to share the gospel with others.

          <h4>The Second Coming</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          Jesus will return on the Last Day to judge all people. Believers will live 
          forever with God in heaven—this hope shapes how we live today.
