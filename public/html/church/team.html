        <h3>Tom Voss</h3>
        <h4>Pastor</h4>
        <div class="bio-text">
          <p>
            Pastor Tom Voss arrived at Martin Luther in the fall of 2020. Tom was born in Milwaukee, WI, 
            then born again into God’s family by Baptism on February 27, 1984. After spending the early years 
            of his childhood at Mt. Olive in Lincoln, NE, his family moved to Christ Our Redeemer in Aurora, CO, 
            being confirmed there on May 3, 1998. His pastoral training began in high school at Luther Prep School 
            in Watertown, WI. He graduated from Martin Luther College in 2006. Tom served as a vicar (pastoral intern) 
            in Ottawa, Ontario in 2008–09, before graduating from Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary with a Master of Divinity 
            in May of 2010.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom was assigned to serve at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church and School in the Seattle, WA area, and was 
            ordained and installed as pastor in July of 2010. In August of 2020, Pastor accepted the call to serve 
            at Martin Luther. In his ministry, he enjoys meeting new people, looking for every opportunity to connect 
            people to the Word of God, and challenging God’s people to consider the true mission of the Church and how 
            they might carry out their discipleship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tom and his wife Kendalyn have four young children: Josefine, Levi, Leora, and Violet. Kendalyn did her 
            undergraduate work at UW–Madison, running track as a Badger, and obtained her Master’s in Speech–Language 
            Pathology. She currently works in that field, doing in-home health and enjoys helping adults recover. Tom 
            loves to golf, Kendalyn enjoys running, and the family looks for every opportunity to explore new adventures. 
            They are excited to live and serve in Oshkosh.
