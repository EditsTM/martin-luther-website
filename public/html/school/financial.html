          The Wisconsin Parental Choice Program (WPCP) provides qualifying families with a voucher to
          attend the private or religious school of their choice <strong>tuition free</strong>. This means that
          your child could attend MLS with <strong>tuition costs covered 100%</strong> by the state of Wisconsin!
        </p>

        <p>
          The application is online, and the funds received through the program greatly benefit our students,
          families, and congregation directly or indirectly.
        </p>

        <p class="center-strong">
          <strong>All eligible families are encouraged to go online and apply!</strong><br />

            If you are applying for the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program for the first time, here is a simple overview
            of the process. More details are available on the Wisconsin DPI website, or by contacting Martin Luther School.
            We are happy to help!
          </p>

          <ol class="steps">
            <li>
              <strong>Check Income Eligibility</strong> The state updates income limits for the new school year each January.
              You can find the current limits above.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Apply During the Monthly Windows</strong> First-time applicants use the same monthly application windows
              as returning families.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Complete the DPI Online Application</strong> You will need to verify your income using one of the two
              state-approved methods:
              <div class="substeps">
                <p><strong>DPI Method:</strong> Enter the adjusted gross income from your 2025 tax return on the DPI application and submit a signed copy of your 1040 to the school you are applying to.</p>
                <p><strong>DOR Method:</strong> Have the Wisconsin Department of Revenue verify your income based on tax returns you have already filed. If your 2025 return has not yet been filed, the state will use your 2024 tax data. You must still submit a signed copy of your 1040 to the school.</p>
              </div>
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Submit Proof of Residency</strong> Proof of residency must be submitted to your school during the same
              application window in which you complete the DPI Online Application. Accepted documents are your WI-2 or January gas,
              water, sewer, property tax, or electric bill as proof of residency.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Application Review and Lottery Process</strong> Once the window closes, the school will verify your application.
              If there are more verified applicants than seats available, the school will follow the state-established preference order.
            </li>
          </ol>
