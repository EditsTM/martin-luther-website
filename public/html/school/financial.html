      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is WPCP?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Eligible students receive a voucher through the program, which covers their ML tuition in full. 
            The voucher remains with the student through their time at ML. Under this program — funded by 
            the State of Wisconsin — parents have a voice in how their tax dollars are spent on the education 
            of their children.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is our family eligible?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>There are two eligibility requirements.</p>

          <p><strong>The first</strong> eligibility requirement is Wisconsin residency. Proofs of residency could include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Preferred (if applicable) – Property Tax Statement</li>
            <li>Current Wage Statement (can be year-end W2)</li>
            <li>Current water, gas, or electric bill (dated within the last 90 days)</li>
            <li>Current lease agreement</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>The second</strong> eligibility requirement involves family income. To meet the 2025–2026 income requirements for the WPCP, a student's family must have an Adjusted Gross Income at or below 220% of the federal poverty level, with an additional $7,000 allowed for a married couple as illustrated below (these numbers are adjusted yearly).</p>

        <button class="faq-question">Are we guaranteed a voucher?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>There are a limited number of WPCP seats available that are designated per grade level. 
            The cap for vouchers in the 2025–2026 school year is scheduled to be 9% of the school district’s 
            total enrollment where the family resides. For school districts where more students apply than the cap allows, 
            students are selected by random draw by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. You will be notified 
            of your selection in May or June.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Will WPCP students be treated differently?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>All students at Martin Luther School will be treated as dearly loved children of God and will be given the same academic 
            and extracurricular options as all students. ML is not new to offering financial aid to families and will treat students 
            in this program just like every other student who we are blessed to teach.
            The identities of our Choice students, as well as other students receiving financial aid, are not readily shared with staff members. 
            They are known by the principal, the MLS Choice Administrator, the MLS treasurer, a person responsible for billing, and an assigned Choice designee.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Does the voucher cover every school-related expense?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The Choice payment covers tuition and education-related fees in full, but it does not cover additional fees not directly related to tuition and education. Such fees would include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hot Lunch</li>
            <li>Extended Day Program (EDP)</li>
            <li>Piano or band lessons</li>
            <li>Extracurricular fees (athletics, robotics, etc.)</li>
            <li>School or sports photos</li>
            <li>Transportation, such as busing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There may be other fees which ML may charge. The above list is not exhaustive. If you have questions, please contact the principal for clarification.</p>
